# Combining Hash Map and Graph for Shortest Path Calculation

This project combines the concepts of hash maps and graphs to implement a system capable of finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm. The goal is to modify and extend the provided hash map and min heap implementations to handle graph data structures effectively.
